# Exploratory_style_titanic_database_analysis_usng_python
Performed an exploratory style data analysis for titanic database on kaggle using python

Analyzed and explored each features individually in the database

Predicted results using 8 different algorithms- Logistics regression, K-nearest Neighbours, Linear support vector machine(SVC), Gradient Boosting Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Decision Tree Classifier, CatBoost Algorithm

CatBoost algorithm gave the best 10 fold Cross-validation accuracy - 83%

This model's predicted result got a public score of 0.77033 on kaggle
